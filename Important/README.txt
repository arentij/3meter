I've compiled some of the most useful code here. Most of it can be found
in /home/dstone/matlab/ as well.

The original code I started working with is in /home/axl/matlabgit/mag/

/data/tech_info/ has a lot of useful technical info and other useful things
about 3 Meter

Most of the information, drafts, data analysis, etc. for Dan Zimmerman's (Axl's)
2014 JGR paper is in /home/axl/tfpaper/

Good luck!
